"realtime" example
==================

This video was recorded using OBS at 60fps, so the framerate and 
jerkiness of the rendering is because it really does take that long to render each frame.

This example was created to aid in profiling the renderer and improve its performance.

It uses the SDL2 master branch to display each rendered frame.
